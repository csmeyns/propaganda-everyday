# Table of contents

[TOC]

# Short essays
**Length**: ca. 500--1000 words.

**Write them for**: modules 02--06.

**General instruction**: 
Write an essay that in some form takes off from, or engages with, the material (readings, talks, video) on everyday propaganda that we're covering that week. Feel free to take an angle that follows your interests. 

Some entry points to consider: Is there anything in the material that seems particularly controversial to you? Or implausible, but nonetheless correct? A counterexample that no one has looked at?

> :bulb: Do take **notes** of things that stand out as you're going through the readings. Notes can considerably speed up the writing process!

Make sure that your essay contains:
- [ ] a **question**
- [ ] an **answer** to that question
- [ ] an **argument** in support of the answer to that question

A practical guide to essay writing that I have found useful is [Writing the Essay: Step by Step](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/aL73dDl+4wZxKlviPO6al3Wp/), from Lewis Vaughn's _Writing Philosophy_ (2006). (Tailored to philosophy, but easily adaptable.)

# Peer feedback

**Format**: Inline comment(s) on work submitted by your colleagues. 

**Write them for**: modules 02--07.

**How to do it**: [Use comments to collaborate asynchronously](https://hackmd.io/s/how-to-use-comments)

**General instructions**: Reading other people's work can make us better writers. Giving and receiving feedback on and from others makes us _yet_ better thinkers and writers. 

Consider the following three points when giving constructive feedback on your colleagues' work:
1. Is the **question** clear?
2. Is the **answer** to its question clear?
3. Is the answer to the question **well supported** by arguments and evidence?

<!-- 1. What works **well**?
2. Where are options for making things **better**?
3. Anything that **stands out** as surprising, remarkable or curious? -->

Remember that it can be quite scary to have your work scrutinised by others! We're all trying our best so let's keep it friendly and constructive :slightly_smiling_face:
