#### Propaganda and the everyday

# Table of Contents

[TOC]

# Basics

**Course description**: In this course we will study the nature and workings of propaganda in everyday contexts. We will look at theoretical approaches to propaganda using key texts. We will also build a propaganda analysis ‘toolkit’ to apply our insights to concrete cases. On this basis we will be able to reflect on some of the key questions that the production, circulation and reception of propagandist material raises--including about: agency, responsibility, ethics and vulnerability, but also about truth, (mis)information, aesthetics, and the social consequences of propaganda as it permeates people’s lives.
