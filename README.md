# Basics

**Course description**: In this course we will study the nature and workings of propaganda in everyday contexts. We will look at theoretical approaches to propaganda using key texts. We will also build a propaganda analysis ‚Äòtoolkit‚Äô to apply our insights to concrete cases. On this basis we will be able to reflect on some of the key questions that the production, circulation and reception of propagandist material raises--including about: agency, responsibility, ethics and vulnerability, but also about truth, (mis)information, aesthetics, and the social consequences of propaganda as it permeates people‚Äôs lives.

**Level**: Postgraduate (masters and PhD level)

**Facilitator**: [Dr Chris Meyns](https://chrismeyns.xyz) (chris.meyns@antro.uu.se)

**Language**: English

Seminars can be helpful for us to learn collaboratively and from each other in real-time communication. Each seminar meeting will have an [agenda of what we'd like to talk about](https://hackmd.io/@chrmns/BJCl6rayY). Participation in seminars is optional.

**Open communication space**: We will use [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/9KAWB8wV) for open course-wide communication. Feel free to use it to ask any questions, share ideas or just to hang out. Participation on the Discord server is completely optional.

## üìç 01: What is Propaganda? [05--12 Oct]
First the basics. We'll start with demarcation and definition questions. When is something propaganda? When it is not? Does it matter? (If so, why? Or why not?) We'll also begin to build a _toolkit_ to  analyse propagandistic material.

## üìç 02: Bots and Algorithms [13--19 Oct]
What role do algorithms play in spreading (or blocking!) quotidian propaganda today? And how about bots? Does it matter, ethically or practically, whether information is spread by humans or through some automation process?

## üìç 03: Propaganda vs. Marketing [20--26 Oct]
Are marketing and advertising simply propaganda by another name? Is propaganda nothing other than the proper marketing of a set of ideas? Do any of these distinctions show up at all in the jumble of people's busy daily lives? We'll take stock.

## üìç 04: Wearing the Message: Clothing [27--02 Nov]
Surely how you dress is just a matter of personal preference? Individual *style* maybe? Or might how we clothe our own (and perhaps our dependents') bodies say something more structural, more systematic? In this module we'll zoom in on the case of _athleisure_ wear, but feel free to bring in examples from any clothing style you fancy!

## üìç 05: Friends & Influence(rs) [03--09 Nov]
Friends wouldn't let friends get caught up in propaganda. Or...? In this module we'll tackle the question of how peer-to-peer information sharing intertwines (or not) with propagating material. What does such sharing mean for trust, credibility and friendship?

## üìç 06: Built Environment [10--16 Nov]
The buildings people live, work and play in can easily fade into the background of their daily routines through cityscapes. But what, if anything, do these building communicate? Is all social housing, or are all office spaces, created equal? And what is the impact of such buildings on the people who use them, or pass by them?
