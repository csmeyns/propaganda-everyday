## Purpose

What is propaganda? What _isn't_? Does it even matter? This course aims to support participants in getting a better grip on how propaganda operates in people's everyday lives. We'll reflect on some of the key questions that the production, circulation and reception of propagandist material raises. Think: issues about: freedom, persuasion, trust, (mis)information and vulnerability. Over the course of the week, we will build a propaganda analysis ‘toolkit’ to apply our insights to concrete cases.

## Format

All-remote (100% online). Talks are pre-recorded and go 'live' daily. Accompanying readings will be made available digitally in advance. We'll meet in daily seminars for an hour or so to dive deeper into issues raised by the material.
